# AI-Powered-Document-and-Graph-Analysis
I am seeking an enthusiastic bright junior AI developer / intern who wants to learn advanced ai while helping me on exciting usecase.  help prototype an innovative idea using Python and OpenAI models. The project involves creating an AI solution that can analyze documents and generate use neo4j graphs. Need to be bright pythoner having basic experience calling openai models (no ml experience needed) will be pivotal in bringing this concept to life.

You will get guidance to solve complex ai usecase and get to learn from an expert while making money for it. I need you to dedicate 3-4 hrs daily be focussed and excited about solving problem and learning advanced ai( no experience needed)

1. Python coding
2. Calling OpenAI models using python
3.  Neo4j exp(nice to have)
4. Building  ux( Django/ flask/ react) - nice to have
---------------
To help you prototype the innovative AI solution you described, the key tasks involve:

    Python coding: Writing code that interacts with OpenAI models, processes documents, and uses Neo4j for graph generation.
    Calling OpenAI Models: Using OpenAI API to analyze documents and generate meaningful outputs.
    Neo4j Graph Generation: Creating graphs that represent relationships extracted from documents.
    Web Framework (Optional): If you want a front-end interface, Django/Flask or React can be used.

Here’s a step-by-step guide and Python code that can help implement this solution. We'll break it down into three main components:
Step 1: Calling OpenAI Models to Analyze Documents

You’ll need to use the OpenAI API to call models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 to analyze a document. This can be done using the openai Python package.
Installing the Required Libraries

pip install openai neo4j

Python Code to Analyze Documents Using OpenAI API

import openai
import os

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

def analyze_document(document_text):
    """
    Function to analyze the document using OpenAI's GPT model.
    This function extracts key information or relationships from the document.
    """
    prompt = f"Analyze the following document and extract key relationships and entities: \n\n{document_text}"

    # Make an API request to OpenAI's GPT model
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use the appropriate GPT model version (davinci, curie, etc.)
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.7
    )

    # Extract the result from the response
    extracted_info = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return extracted_info

# Example document text
document_text = """
John Doe is a senior software engineer at Tech Innovations. He recently collaborated with Jane Smith, a product manager at Innovate Corp. 
Together, they worked on developing a new product that integrates AI technologies.
"""
extracted_info = analyze_document(document_text)
print("Extracted Information:", extracted_info)

In this code:

    We use OpenAI’s GPT model to analyze the document text and extract key relationships, such as names, companies, and collaborations.
    You can expand the prompt to focus on specific document analysis (e.g., entity extraction, summarization, etc.).

Step 2: Using Neo4j for Graph Generation

Once you have the extracted information, you can convert it into a graph format and store it in Neo4j.
Installing Neo4j Python Library

pip install neo4j

Python Code to Create and Store Graphs in Neo4j

from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Neo4j connection setup
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Update this based on your Neo4j instance
username = "neo4j"
password = "password"  # Your Neo4j password
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))

def create_graph_from_info(info):
    """
    Function to create nodes and relationships in Neo4j based on the extracted information.
    """
    with driver.session() as session:
        # You can customize how the information is represented in Neo4j
        for line in info.split('\n'):
            entities = line.split(',')
            if len(entities) >= 2:
                person_1, person_2 = entities[0].strip(), entities[1].strip()
                session.write_transaction(create_relationship, person_1, person_2)

def create_relationship(tx, person_1, person_2):
    """
    Create nodes and relationships in Neo4j based on the extracted information.
    """
    tx.run("MERGE (a:Person {name: $person_1}) "
           "MERGE (b:Person {name: $person_2}) "
           "MERGE (a)-[:COLLABORATED_WITH]->(b)", person_1=person_1, person_2=person_2)

# Example input from the OpenAI model output
extracted_info = """
John Doe is a senior software engineer at Tech Innovations.
Jane Smith is a product manager at Innovate Corp.
John Doe and Jane Smith collaborated on AI product development.
"""

# Create the graph based on the extracted info
create_graph_from_info(extracted_info)

In this code:

    We use the neo4j Python driver to interact with a Neo4j instance running on localhost:7687.
    We create nodes for each person and add relationships between them (such as COLLABORATED_WITH).

Step 3: Optional - Building a Simple UI with Flask (Optional)

If you want to create a simple web-based user interface for this solution, you can use Flask to build a minimal application.
Installing Flask

pip install Flask

Basic Flask App

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
import os
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI and Neo4j setup
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
username = "neo4j"
password = "password"
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))

# Flask route to handle document analysis and graph creation
@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_and_create_graph():
    document_text = request.json.get("document_text")
    
    # Step 1: Analyze document using OpenAI model
    extracted_info = analyze_document(document_text)
    
    # Step 2: Create a graph based on the extracted info
    create_graph_from_info(extracted_info)
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Document analyzed and graph created successfully", "extracted_info": extracted_info})

# Analyze document using OpenAI
def analyze_document(document_text):
    prompt = f"Analyze the following document and extract key relationships and entities: \n\n{document_text}"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003", 
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    extracted_info = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return extracted_info

# Neo4j graph creation
def create_graph_from_info(info):
    with driver.session() as session:
        for line in info.split('\n'):
            entities = line.split(',')
            if len(entities) >= 2:
                person_1, person_2 = entities[0].strip(), entities[1].strip()
                session.write_transaction(create_relationship, person_1, person_2)

def create_relationship(tx, person_1, person_2):
    tx.run("MERGE (a:Person {name: $person_1}) "
           "MERGE (b:Person {name: $person_2}) "
           "MERGE (a)-[:COLLABORATED_WITH]->(b)", person_1=person_1, person_2=person_2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

In this Flask app:

    You can send a POST request with document_text to the /analyze endpoint.
    The app will analyze the document, extract key relationships using OpenAI, and create a graph in Neo4j.

Conclusion

This Python code and workflow will help you prototype your innovative AI-powered solution. You can:

    Use OpenAI models to analyze and process documents.
    Use Neo4j to represent relationships from documents in graph form.
    Optionally build a web interface using Flask for user interaction.

This project is a great opportunity for a junior developer or intern to learn by working on a real-world AI solution while being mentored.
